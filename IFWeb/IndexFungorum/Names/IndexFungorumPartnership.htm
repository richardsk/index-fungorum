            Index Fungorum is a community resource currently co-ordinated and supported by
            <a href="http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/" target="_blank">Landcare Research</a> 
            (the custodian). The custodian claims no IPR over the compilation, which 
            correctly reside with the many contributors. It is free of any charge to the 
            community on a non-commercial use basis. It should be cited as
            <a href="http://www.indexfungorum.org/">www.indexfungorum.org</a>; a more 
            formal&nbsp;citation should include the names of the custodian as above and the date 
            of access. The custodian is grateful to the
            <a href="http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/">iPlantCollaborative</a> for 
            hosting Index Fungorum.<br />
            <br />
            The present custodian cannot make any promises to continue in the task of 
            support and co-ordination indefinitely. Should the custodian be unable to 
            continue, and designate another appropriate custodian(s), it will make available 
            a copy of this resource as at that time in a suitable format (and at no charge) 
            to the <a href="http://biologi.uio.no/org/ima/" target="_blank">International 
            Mycological Association</a> (or the most appropriate division of the IUMS or 
            IUBS, or it's successor) for necessary action to ensure its continued 
            availability to the community which created it.<br />

            The <a href="http://www.cabi.org/AbstractDatabases.asp?PID=514" target="_blank">
            Index of Fungi</a> is a publication from <a href="http://www.cabi.org" 
                target="_blank">CABI</a> and currently provides most of the names published 
            in &#39;non main-stream&#39; publications and the &#39;grey&#39; literature;
            <a href="http://www.mycobank.org">MycoBank</a> provides the majority. The production of this publication entirely 
            depends on subscription income under the current business model. Certain data 
            elements (name string, author string, year of publication) from the Index of 
            Fungi are made available through Index Fungorum. The remaining data elements are 
            not immediately available but are made so after five years. In the event of the 
            cessation of the compilation of the Index of Fungi the custodians will attempt 
            to ensure a mechanism for the continuation of notification, through Index 
            Fungorum, of newly published names.
