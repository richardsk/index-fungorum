<h2>Searching the Index Fungorum database</h2>
Searching the Index Fungorum database, and the other databases on this site, works 
best if you have &#8216;cookies&#8217; enabled on your browser. Disabling cookies 
will stop you from navigating between pages of records and traversing the taxonomic 
hierarchy.<br>
<br>
The logo at the top left (the idea came from <a href="mailto:%20k.hudson@cabi.org">Ken 
Hudson</a> who is the present compilor of the Index of Fungi) indicates that the 
underlying database is both a nomenclator (a database of names with nomenclatural 
opinions) and potentially a checklist of the fungi of the world (names with taxonomic 
opinions as either a current name or a synonym). The &#8216;S&#8217; (from Species 
Fungorum) encircling the &#8216;IF&#8217; (from Index Fungorum) graphically illustrates 
that for any checklist it is essential to have an underlying nomenclatural component.<br>
<br>
Search for publication and other details of a fungus name by entering either the 
name or the epithet (both specific and infraspecific epithets are searched together). 
Your entry can be right-truncated (do not add a * or % to the end of the search 
string - we will do that for you), e.g. &#8216;Agaricus am&#8217; will find all 
names within the genus &#8216;Agaricus&#8217;, where the first two letters of 
the epithet start with &#8216;am&#8217;.<br>
<br>
The database search restricts you to 6000 records so if you enter something as 
vague as &#8216;A&#8217; you will <b>not</b> get all the records &#8211; try and 
be a bit more specific. The restriction is sufficient to return all records for 
the largest genus (<i>Lecidea</i>), if you really want to scroll through 30 pages 
of results, or the most common epithet. Please be kind to our server and be specific, 
literally!<br>
<br>
Names with <font color="#0000FF"><strong>blue</strong></font> links are names 
for which there is no taxonomic opinion available, <font color="#FF0000"><strong>red</strong></font> 
links are misapplied names (names which have been used in a sense which is different 
from that as represented by the type of the name), <font color="#339900"><strong>green</strong></font> 
links are names where a taxonomic opinion has been expressed and lead directly 
to the approporiate page in the <a href="http://www.SpeciesFungorum.org">Species 
Fungorum</a> web site.<br>
<br>
Click on an entry to see more data. Full publication details are provided for 
some entries from CABI&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cabi.org/AbstractDatabases.asp?PID=514" target="_blank">Index 
of Fungi</a>. However, full details of names published during the last 5 years 
have been omitted. If you want these data then take out a subscription to the 
publication and support it's production; see the final paragraph in the <a href="IndexFungorumPartnership.htm">Index 
Fungorum Partnership</a> agreement for details.<br>
<br>
Entries with &#8216;[GSD]&#8217; or &#8216;[RSD]&#8217; have onward links to <a href="../GSD/Gsd.htm">Global 
Species Databases</a> (part of <a href="http://www.SpeciesFungorum.org">Species 
Fungorum</a>) or Regional Species Databases and full synonymy data.<br>
<br>
For most entries the taxonomic hierarchy attached to a name is either derived 
from the nomenclatural position of the genus through its type (thus <i>Helotium</i> 
appears in the Tricholomataceae because the type of <i>Helotium</i> is a basidiomycete), 
or in some cases through the presumed position based on an assesment of associated 
homotypic names. Only in GSD data, or other data for which a taxonomic opinion 
is available (and which contribute to the Catalogue of Life - see <a href="http://www.species2000.org/" target="_blank">Species 
2000</a>), is the correct taxonomic position of a name known through the position 
of the currently accepted name.<br>
<br>
The database has been derived from a number of published lists including Saccardo&#146;s 
Sylloge Fungorum, Petrak&#146;s Lists, Saccardo&#146;s Omissions, Lamb&#146;s 
Index, Zahlbruckner&#146;s Catalogue of Lichens (comprehensive for names at species 
level only but with an increasing number of names of infraspecific taxa) and the 
Index of Fungi. A name record will usually have a reference to an entry in one 
or more of these published lists in addition to other data derived from numerous 
<a href="Names/acknowledge.htm">acknowledged</a> sources. Author citations conform 
with the <a href="http://www.kewbooks.com/asps/ShowDetails.asp?id=23">Brummitt 
&amp; Powell</a> standard (now searchable on-line <a href="AuthorsOfFungalNames.asp">here</a> 
or through <a href="http://www.ipni.org">IPNI</a>), or are indicated '{?}' thus.<br>
