          <td>Index Fungorum is a community resource currently co-ordinated and 
            supported by the following partnership: <a href="http://www.cabi-bioscience.org/" target="_blank">CABI 
            Bioscience</a>, <a href="http://www.cbs.knaw.nl/" target="_blank">CBS</a> 
            and <a href="http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/" target="_blank">Landcare 
            Research</a> (the custodians). The custodians, either collectively 
            or individually, claim no IPR over the compilation, which correctly 
            reside with the many contributors, including the custodians. It is 
            free of any charge to the community on a non-commercial use basis. 
            It should be cited as <a href="http://www.indexfungorum.org/" target="_blank">www.indexfungorum.org</a>; 
            a more formal citation should include the names of the custodians 
            as above and the date of access.<br> <br>
            Neither one of the present custodians can make any promises to continue 
            in the task of support and co-ordination indefinitely. However, they 
            all assure, unconditionally, that if any one can no longer be involved 
            on the above cited basis the remaining two will continue on this same 
            basis.<br> <br>
            Should all three be unable to be involved on the above cited basis 
            the last remaining custodian(s) will make available a copy of this 
            resource as at that time in a suitable format (and at no charge) to 
            the <a href="http://biologi.uio.no/org/ima/" target="_blank">International 
            Mycological Association</a> (or the most appropriate division of the 
            IUMS or IUBS, or it’s successor) for necessary action to ensure its 
            continued availability to the community which created it.<br> <br>
            The <a href="http://www.cabi-publishing.org/products/taxonomy/IOF/Index.asp" target="_blank">Index 
            of Fungi</a> is a publication from <a href="http://www.cabi-publishing.org" target="_blank">CABI 
            Publishing</a> compiled by <a href="http://www.cabi-bioscience.org" target="_blank">CABI 
            Bioscience</a> and currently provides the majority of recently published 
            names. The production of this publication entirely depends on subscription 
            income under the current business model. Certain data elements (name 
            string, author string, year of publication) from the Index of Fungi 
            are made available through Index Fungorum. The remaining data elements 
            are not immediately available but are made so after five years. In 
            the event of the cessation of the compilation of the Index of Fungi 
            the custodians will attempt to ensure a mechanism for the continuation 
            of notification, through Index Fungorum, of newly published names.</td>
