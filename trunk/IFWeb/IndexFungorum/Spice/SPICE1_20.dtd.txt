<!-- DTD for SPICE Response 2001 December,20 -->
<!-- Which compatible with SPICE CDM1.20    -->
<!-- Here the expression of Exception and the Enum in XML DTD is still a problem, we will defer to XMLSchema which have powerful to do it -->
<!-- In DTD,
    (Item1 |Item2) means: that separates a set of alternatives, only one may appear;
    (Item*) means the Item appears zero or more times;
    (Item1, item2,Item3) means separates items in a sequences in the order in which they appear;
    (Item+) means item appear at least once;
    (Item?) means the item appears once or not at all.
    #PCDATA  is parsed character data which may contain XML markup and hence has to be handled by the XML parser.
    #CDATA is plain text character data which is not parsed through the engine of the XML parser. The default data type for elements is PCDATA but CDATA can be very useful. 
    For Attribute, the meaning of the following KEYWORDs are :
    #REQUIRED means that the attribute must be included when the element is used. Failure to do so will result in the parser raising an error. 
    #FIXED means as a default, a specific value will be used if the attribute is not included.
    #IMPLIED optional and can be safely ignored if no value is given.
