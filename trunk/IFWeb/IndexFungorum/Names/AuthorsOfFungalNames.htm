      <h3 align="center">AUTHORS OF FUNGAL NAMES</h3>
      Authors of Fungal Names was published in 1992 as a supplement to the Index 
of Fungi. It is now out of print and also out of date. During the intervening 
years details of about 3000 new fungal name authors have been accumulated, during 
the production of the Index of Fungi and also during the augmentation of the data 
available in Index Fungorum. It was thought that the most appropriate way to make 
these details available was not to formally produce a second edition of the Supplement 
(which would require a charge to obtain it) but to make it available in a variety 
of formats for download, free of charge to the end user. So, here it is ;-)<br>
<br>
Authors Of Fungal Names, version 2, January 2003 (omissions and errors to <a href="mailto:p.kirk@cabi.org">Paul
