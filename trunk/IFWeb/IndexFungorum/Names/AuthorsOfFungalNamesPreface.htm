      <h3 align="center">AUTHORS OF FUNGAL NAMES: PREFACE TO PRINTED EDITION</h3>
In compiling this list many sources were consulted. The starting point was the list published by Hawksworth (1980), 
augmented by a register of names built up over two decades or more by the various compilers of the <i>Index of Fungi</i>. 
Added to this was information from the <i>Index of Fungi</i> database (1981-1991), the printed volumes of the <i>Index of Fungi</i> 
(1940-1980, vol. 1-4), <i>Petraks Lists</i> (1920-1939, parts 1-8 and supplement, 1969), <i>Index of Fungi Supplements</i>, 
<i>Lichens 1961-1969</i> (1972) and <i>Saccardo's Omission</i>s (1985). The authors of those citations in Lindau & Sydow's 
<i>Thesaurus litteraturae mycologicae et lichenologicae</i> (1908-1917) and the supplement to this work by Ciferri (1957-1960), 
where new names were published, were extracted by B.M. Spooner and D.N. Pegler and added to the list. Other sources included 
the register of yeast names in Barnett, Payne & Yarrow, <i>The Yeasts</i> (1983), and those lists cited by Hawksworth (1980), see 
below. Abbreviations for the large number of previously unlisted names were formulated, according to the agreed principles, by 
D.N. Pegler and B.M. Spooner. Included in this list are authors who have effectively published, but not necessarily validly 
published, names since they may be included in 'ex' citations. All authors of mycological, including lichenological, 
literature included in F.A. Stafleu & R.S. Cowan's second edition of <i>Taxonomic Literature</i> (1976-1988) <i>TL-2</i>) have 
been included even though some of them may never have published names of fungi.<br>
<br>
For more information on the compilation of the full list and for details of sources of information for each of the major groups 
of organisms, including all acknowledgements, biographical data, and how the many problems associated with determining what 
constitutes the operative surname, and how it should be spelled, were resolved the reader is referred to the Introduction in 
Brummitt & Powell (1992, <i>Authors of Plant Names</i>, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew) the full list referred to above. However, 
it would be useful to repeat here the principles which were adopted by the working group and employed to derive the standard 
forms given in this list.<br>
<br>
The 'standard form' for an author of a fungus name is the surname, or an abbreviation of it, or rarely a contraction of it, 
with or without initials or other distinguishing appendages. The standard form adopted here is the product of the interaction of 
all the principles, of which one may be of paramount importance in one circumstance but less so in another. Few of the principles 
listed below are absolute rules. Experience has shown that with rigid rules, sooner or later it becomes inconvenient or undesirable 
to follow them.<br>
<br>
The first four 'principles' are applied rigidly as absolute rules:<br>
<br>
1.	<i>Script</i>. Names are in Roman characters.<br>
<br>
2.	<i>Uniqueness</i>. Every 'standard form' must be unique to one person.<br>
<br>
3.	<i>Uniform treatment of names</i>. The same surname (i.e. identical spelling) must always be given in the same form, 
unless it is part of a compound name, and different surnames must not be given the same form.<br>
<br>
4.	<i>Full-stops and accents</i>. All abbreviations and contractions are terminated by a full-stop but the full-stop does not 
make a standard form different from the same spelling without a full stop (e.g. Lam. for Lamarck and Lam for H.J. Lam are treated 
as homonymous, and initials are required for the latter's standard form). Similarly, names differing only by the presence or 
absence of an accent (e.g. Leonard and Léonard) are treated as homonyms.<br>
<br>
The remaining principles are not considered absolutely binding except for 12. The first, no. 5, over-rides all the subsequent 
ones. Those from 6 to 11 refer to full surnames and when to include initials and other appendages, while 12 to 14 refer to 
when and how to abbreviate surnames.<br>
<br>
5. <i>TL-2 as standard</i>. The standard forms recommended in TL-2 are retained in the majority of cases. Reasons for departing 
from <i>TL-2</i> include: (a) contravention of principle 2 and 3 above (rare); (b) in the case of authors of flowering plants, serious 
conflict with the <i>Draft Index of Author Abbreviations</i> (Meikle, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, 1980 and supplement 1984) 
involving transfer of one standard form from one author to another; (c) failure to abbreviate very long names; (d) rather excessive 
abbreviation of short names were no outstandingly strong precedent appears to exist (e.g. Wilson is given in full rather than 
abbreviated to Wils.); (c) failure to give any of a large number of authors with the same surname a standard form without initials; 
(f) occasionally, conflict with particularly well established abbreviations used elsewhere.<br>
<br>
The following principles are applied to names of authors not appearing in <i>TL-2</i>.<br>
<br>
6. <i>Surname only</i>. A surname alone, or its abbreviation or contraction, is adopted as the standard form if it is applicable to 
only one author in the list. A surname alone, or its abbreviation or contraction, is usually also adopted for one of a number of 
authors with the same surname (see 7 below).<br>
<br>
7. <i>Initials</i>. Persons with identical surnames are distinguished by use of initials of forenames, except as in 8 and 9 below. 
Usually the earliest born is given without initials and all later ones with initials, but in some cases a better known later author 
may be given without and all others, including the earliest, with initials. Occasionally, when all having the same surname are 
more or less contemporary and equally well known, all may be given initials, Where initials are required: (a) if the author has 
one forename, then one initial is given; (b) if the author has two forenames, both are given, except in occasional cases where 
the author consistently omits one initial in authorship of books or papers (as distinct from authorship of fungal names), e.g. 
W. Gams for K.W. Gams who almost invariably publishes his work using only one of his fornames; (c) if the author has three forenames, 
three initials are given unless the author has a clear preference for using only one and no ambiguity arises; if the author has 
more than three forenames, an <i>ad hoc</i> decision is taken. It was recommended by the Working Group that no spaces be left 
after full stops but as this is a matter of style of presentation in printed matter it is not adopted here.<br>
<br>
8. <i>Abbreviated or full forenames</i>. When two authors have identical surnames and initials, full or abbreviated forenames 
may be used. One author may be given with only surname, or initial(s) plus surname, and the other with fuller names, or both 
may be given with fuller names, e.g. J. Walker for John Walker (1930-) and Jane Walker for Jane Walker (pub. 1983).<br>
<br>
9. <i>Suffixes</i>. In a few cases persons with identical surnames may be distinguished by a suffix instead of, or in addition 
to, initials. In well known cases of father and son, the son may be distinguished by 'f.', an abbreviation for 'filius' (e.g. 
Hirats. and Hirats. f.). Where this follows an abbreviated name with a full-stop it was recommended that no space be left between 
the full-stop and f., but this is also a matter of style of presentation and is not adopted here. Tradition may also allow a 
different suffix, such as 'Arg.' for 'Argoviensis' in Müll. Arg. (Müller of Aargau). In a few cases where different authors 
have identical surname and forename we have used the suffix 'bis' for the second and 'ter' for the third, as in F.R. Jones and 
F.R. Jones bis for Fred Revel Jones (1884-1956) and F.R. Jones (pub. 1964).<br>
<br>
10. <i>Variant names for the same person</i>. Except as noted in 11 below, one person is always given the same standard form, 
even though they may have modified the spelling of their surname during their lifetime or different transliterations may exist, 
or a compounding form may have been adopted during their lifetime.<br>
<br>
11. <i>Different names for the same person</i>. When a person has published under completely different names, different standard 
forms may be used for the same person. For example, Gustaf Oskar Andersson later took up the name Malme, G.O.A., and both may 
be used in standard forms as G.O. Andersson and Malme respectively.<br>
<br>
The following principles concern when and how to abbreviate surnames. It should be noted again that these have been applied 
only to names not given in TL-2 (see 5 above).<br>
<br>
12. <i>Where to abbreviate</i>. Names are never abbreviated before a consonant.<br>
<br>
13. <i>How many letters to save</i>.<br>
(a)	Names are usually not abbreviated unless more than two letters are eliminated and replaced by a full-stop.<br>
(b)	Names of authors living before the 20th century are more likely to be abbreviated than later ones, and names of authors 
in the late 20th century tend to be given in full.<br>
(c)	Where no strong tradition exists, names of 8 letters or fewer are not abbreviated, names of 9 letters are abbreviated 
if more than three letters are eliminated, and names of ten letters or more are usually abbreviated.<br>
(d)	Other things being equal, if an abbreviation is made, 2-syllable names are abbreviated to one syllable, 3-syllable names 
are more likely to be abbreviated to one, and names of 4 or more syllables are most often abbreviated to two syllables. 
Many Japanese names have four short syllables, and we have tried to be consistent, where they are of eight or more letter, 
in abbreviating them to two syllables, except where ambiguity would occur.<br>
(e)	Application of these principles may depend on whether initials are also needed in standard forms of well known authors. 
Decisions may also be affected when an author is known to be comonly cited as a joint author with somebody else.<br>

USERS GUIDE<br>
<br>
Authors are listed alphabetically (accents ignored) by their surname, followed by their forename(s) where know or initial(s) when 
the full name(s) is not known. Alternative spellings of surnames, for example, as a result of transliteration of cyrillic or 
chinese names, with cross reference to the accepted names, are given in round brackets when the alternative forms have been 
found in the literature; no attempt is made to give all possible spelling variants. Where doubt exists as to what constitutes 
the surname, such as when prefixes occur or when compound names are involved, alternative forms are listed in brackets with 
cross reference to the accepted form. When the same author has published under two completely different names, both include 
cross references to the other, and separate abbreviations are given for each. (e.g. Lindroth, Johan Ivar and Liro, Johan Ivar). 
If only one name has been used for publication of new fungus names, others may be held in the database but are not printed here. 
Alternative spelling of forenames are given in square brackets (e.g. Karsten, Petter [Peter] Adolf); little used forenames are 
given in round brackets (e.g. Rchm, Heinrich (Simon Ludwig Friedrich Felix)); informal names are given in round brackets but 
enclosed by single quotation marks (e.g. Thompson, Aldworth William ('Tommy')).<br>
<br>
After the forename(s) or initial(s) is the date of birth and/or death, as applicable and as far as ascertained, in round brackets. 
Where neither date of birth or death is know, the date when the author is know to have published a name is given after the 
abbreviation 'pub.'. Following the date, justified to the right, is the recommended 'standard form' of the name.<br>
