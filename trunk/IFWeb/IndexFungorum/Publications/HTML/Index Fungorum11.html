Kirk,&nbsp;fam.nov.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>IF550011</b><br>Sporangiophores arising from aerial hyphae or directly from the substratum mycelium, simple or sympodially branched, curved when young, erect at maturity (transitorily recurved). Sporangia terminal, multi-spored, deliquescent-walled; some species also forming lateral, uni-spored or few-spored, pedicellate, persistent-walled, sporangiola.

Kirk,&nbsp;fam.nov.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>IF550009</b><br>Colonies slowly growing, 1-3 mm high without a host, galls formed on susceptable mucoralean hosts. No growth above 30 &#176;C; mesophilic. Hyphae composed of white or ochraceous, thin-walled, branched hyphae. Subaerial hyphae with irregular, sucker-like branches. Stolons and rhizoids produced. Sporangiophores simple or branched, single, not in whorls, curved to circinate, with a subsporangial septum. Sporangia globose to obpiriform, apophysate, wall deliquescing, usually leaving a prominent collar around the columella. Columella more or less globose, smooth, without apical projections. Sporangiospores hyaline, ovoid or slightly cylindrical, smooth-walled, relatively small. Zygospores globose to hemisphaerical, brown, wall ornamented (warted), with opposed suspensors equal in size and without appendages. Predominantly homothallic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holotype:&nbsp;<i>Lentamyces</i> Kerst. Hoffm. & K. Voigt 2008.<br><br>Saprobes in soil. Cosmopolitan.<br><br></p><p><b>Rhizopodaceae</b> K. Voigt &amp; P.M. Kirk,&nbsp;fam.nov.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>IF550010</b><br>Sporangiophores arising either opposite rhizoids or directly from the substratum, simple or branched, several times dichotomously branched, sometimes terminated by an umbel of globose, apophysate, fugacious, columellate and multi-spored sporangia, sometimes forming a secondary umbel that branches dichotomously, one branch terminating in a sporangium and other in a sterile spine; stolons produced; rhizoids typically abundant, formed near the base of the sporangiophores. Sporangia apophysate, multi-spored or few-spored, with an evanescent wall with surface cracks at maturity revealing a dry, grayish, spore-mass; when mature the columella often collapsing over the apex of the sporangiophore, occasionally forming abortive sporangia that may or may not form abortive sporangiospores (cf. Amylomyces). Sporangiospores variously shaped (globose to ellipsoid), wall often striate or spinose or granulate. Chlamydospores formed in the vegetative hyphae, variously shaped. Zygospores with a pigmented, ornamented, rough wall on more or less equal, opposed, non-appendaged suspensors. Heterothallic and homothallic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holotype:&nbsp;<i>Rhizopus</i> Ehrenb. 1821.<br><br>Saprobes in soil, especially in sandy rhizosphere of deciduous trees (<i>Betula</i>, <i>Larix</i>).
